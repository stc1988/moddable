These guides cover working with binary data in Embedded JavaScript — the standard [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) and [`TypedArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) objects, conversions to and from strings, Base64, and hexadecimal, checksums, and compression.

Unlike most other guides, binary data is not a single API. Many operations use features built into the XS JavaScript engine, including web standard APIs and Moddable SDK extensions such as `ArrayBuffer.fromString()`. Others are provided by Moddable SDK modules that you add to your project only when needed. The [Building](#building) section lists the modules used by these guides.

## Building

Many operations in these guides are built into the XS JavaScript engine and require no manifest changes. These include converting between strings and `ArrayBuffer` with `ArrayBuffer.fromString()` and `String.fromArrayBuffer()`, working with immutable and resizable `ArrayBuffer`s, combining buffers with `concat()`, and Base64 and hexadecimal encoding with the `Uint8Array` methods `toBase64()`, `fromBase64()`, `toHex()`, and `fromHex()`.

Other operations are provided by Moddable SDK modules. 

| Feature | Import | Manifest |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `TextEncoder` | `text/encoder` | `$(MODDABLE)/modules/data/text/encoder/manifest.json` |
| `TextDecoder` | `text/decoder` | `$(MODDABLE)/modules/data/text/decoder/manifest.json` |
| CRC (`CRC8`, `CRC16`) | `crc` | `$(MODDABLE)/modules/data/crc/manifest.json` |
| Compression (`Deflate`) | `deflate` | `$(MODDABLE)/modules/data/zlib/manifest_deflate.json` |
| Decompression (`Inflate`) | `inflate` | `$(MODDABLE)/modules/data/zlib/manifest_inflate.json` |

When building with `mcconfig`, add the manifests needed to your project.

When building with `mcpack`, manifests are automatically included for any of these modules used in an `import` statement. Further, the `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` globals are initialized if your project uses them.
