The Wi-Fi Access Point APIs create a Wi-Fi base station running on an embedded device. Other devices can connect to the access point to access its services. Wi-Fi Access Points on embedded devices are commonly used for local device provisioning flows. The Moddable SDK provides the [Captive Portal module](../../examples/io/wifiaccesspoint/captiveportal/) for provisioning, building on a Wi-Fi Access Point. The Wi-Fi Access Point APIs are an [ECMA-419 Network Interface](https://419.ecma-international.org/#network-interface-class-pattern) with extensions that are expected to be defined as part of ECMA-419 5th Edition.

Most microcontrollers allow a device to be a Wi-Fi Access Point and at the same time also be connected to another Wi-Fi Access Point. Wi-Fi performance is often reduced when both are in use.

The Moddable SDK provides Wi-Fi Access Point support for ESP32, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi Pico, and Zephyr.

## Using ECMA-419 Wi-Fi Access Point Network Interface

- [Create Access Point](./create.md)
- [Close Access Point](./close.md)
- [Get Information](./info.md)
- [Manage Stations](./stations.md)
- [DNS Redirect](./dns.md)
- [Provide HTTP Server](./httpserver.md)

## Building with mcconfig

Include the Wi-Fi Access Point Network Interface manifest in your project's `manifest.json`:

	$(MODDABLE)/modules/io/wifiaccesspoint/manifest.json

Then, import the module in your JavaScript source code:

```js
import WiFiAccessPoint from "embedded:network/interface/wifi/accesspoint";
```

## Building with mcpack

Import the module in your JavaScript source code. `mcpack` automatically includes the manifest.

```js
import WiFiAccessPoint from "embedded:network/interface/wifi/accesspoint";
```
