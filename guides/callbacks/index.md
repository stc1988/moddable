The web standard Timers API (e.g. [`setTimeout`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout)) and the Moddable SDK's [`Timer`](../../documentation/base/base.md#timer) module are both available to Embedded JavaScript developers using the Moddable SDK. In fact, the Web platform's Timers API is implemented using the Moddable SDK's `Timer` module.

## Using Timer module

- [One-Time Callback](./callback-one-time.md)
- [Repeating Callback](./callback-repeating.md)
- [Repeating Callback with Initial Delay](./callback-repeating-initial-delay.md)
- [Immediate Callback](./callback-immediate.md)
- [Reschedule Callback](./callback-reschedule.md)
- [Cancel Callback](./callback-cancel.md)
- [Suspend Callback](./callback-suspend.md)

## How to Choose

The Moddable SDK prefers `Timer` for callbacks because it provides greater control and efficiency for Embedded JavaScript than the Web platform's `setTimeout()` family. `Timer` supports one-time, repeating, and immediate callbacks, and callbacks can be rescheduled, suspended, and canceled.

There is only benefit to using the Web platform's Timers API: code portability.

## Building with mcconfig

The `Timer` module is included in every Moddable SDK build, so no manifest changes are required. Import it in your JavaScript source code:

```js
import Timer from "timer";
```

To use the Web platform's Timers API, include its manifest in your project's `manifest.json`:

	$(MODDABLE)/modules/web/timers/manifest.json

The `setTimeout()` family of functions is installed as globals by the module, so no import is required.

## Building with mcpack

When building with `mcpack`, the `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, and `setImmediate()` functions, along with the corresponding `clearTimeout()`,` clearInterval()`, and `clearImmediate()` functions, are automatically installed if your project uses them.
