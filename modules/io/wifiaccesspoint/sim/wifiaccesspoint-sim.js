/*
	Simulated ECMA-419 Wi-Fi Access Point Network Interface.

	The access point is simulated: nothing here touches the host computer's Wi-Fi
	radio, and no device can really associate with it. One station is simulated a
	couple of seconds after the access point comes up, so that onConnect and the
	Station class can be exercised.

	The IP and MAC addresses reported are the host computer's, because a project that
	brings up an access point usually goes on to serve something at that address, and
	a server started here really is reachable there.
